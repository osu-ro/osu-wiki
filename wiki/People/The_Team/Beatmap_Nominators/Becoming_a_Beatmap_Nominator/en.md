# Becoming a Beatmap Nominator

Users interested in joining the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) need to go through an application process overseen by the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team) (NAT).

Applications are conducted via the [NAT website](http://bn.mappersguild.com/bnapps).

Applicants are required to meet a minimum [kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu) threshold, submit at least two maps they have recently modded, and complete a [Beatmap Nominator Test](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Nominator_Test) on the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) in order to submit their application. A message from the NAT will be sent once a verdict has been decided. More information on applying can be found on the website.

## Basic criteria

Modders aiming to apply to the Beatmap Nominators must fulfil the following criteria:

- They have accumulated at least 200 [kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu) for osu! modders, or 150 [kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu) for osu!taiko/osu!catch/osu!mania modders.
- They provide 3 of their mods which they think qualify them to be a part of the Beatmap Nominators.
  - Previous members of BN/NAT are allowed to submit a minimum of 2 mods for their application.

### Modding expectations

Submitted mods should show that a user is capable of analysing and improving maps to a standard fit for the Beatmap Nominators.

The following are modding traits expected of Beatmap Nominators. Failure to display any of these traits may result in a rejected application.

- **Coverage of all difficulty levels**
- **Identification of unrankable issues, including ones tools can't detect, such as incorrect timing or metadata**
- **Comparison between parts of a map to support issues or suggestions**
- **Commentary about a wide variety of map elements, such as rhythm, spacing, movement, intensity, contrast, and consistency**
- **Identification of both isolated issues and general map-wide issues**
- **Consideration of mappers' intentions when identifying issues and giving suggestions**

### How new potential Beatmap Nominators are chosen

- Modders will be evaluated by the corresponding NAT members of the game mode they applied for, taking into account the following criteria:
  - General attitude: Tone of delivery of the mods and other behavioural expectations from the [Code of Conduct](/wiki/Rules/Code_of_Conduct_for_Modding_and_Mapping), as well as general behaviour in chat/forums.
  - Modding abilities: Knowledge of the general [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) and specific criteria of each game mode. Additional abilities like Metadata, Timing, and some others will also be taken into consideration.
- After evaluating each modder, a discussion will be made on whether the modder will join the Beatmap Nominators.

## Cooldowns

Depending on your status, your cooldown before you can apply again may vary.

### Failed applications

You have these requirements if you failed a Beatmap Nominator application and apply again.

| Type | Cooldown |
| :-- | :-- |
| Standard | 90 days |
| Reduced | 45â€“60 days |
| Failed the [Beatmap Nominator Test](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Nominator_Test) | 30 days |

### Rejoining after being removed from the Beatmap Nominators

Users who have recently left the Beatmap Nominators may have different requirements to rejoin compared to when they first joined. For users who have performed well prior to leaving, they may be able to rejoin with relaxed requirements, or no requirements at all. The NAT will inform the user if they have the opportunity to fast-track their way back into the Beatmap Nominators.

If you were a Beatmap Nominator before, these requirements apply unless you have failed an application since last time you were a Beatmap Nominator.

The 8-mod requirement for those applying after being removed for activity is shared across all modes.

| Type | Cooldown | Activity Requirements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Standard | 60 days | *N/A* |
| Activity | 30 days | 8 mods in 60 days |
| Good | 30 days | *N/A* |

Former beatmap nominators who resigned on good terms within the past 6 months are given the option to instantly request a rejoin as a full member, without having to take the [Beatmap Nominator Test](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Beatmap_Nominator_Test), nor provide mods for evaluation.

Former Beatmap Nominators who resigned on good terms within the past year still have to reapply properly in order to rejoin, and they will become full members immediately upon getting accepted.
