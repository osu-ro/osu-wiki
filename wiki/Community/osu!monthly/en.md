# osu!monthly

**osu!monthly** is a monthly newsletter managed by the [osu!monthly team](/wiki/People/osu!monthly_team), with the goal of summarising the various community and official events, news, announcements, etc. that occur every month. The project has been led by several other groups of community members in the past, with the goal always being the same: inform the average player about the previous and current events in order to shed light over the entire osu! community.

## Contributing

The osu!monthly is a community effort, so anyone who wants to help or contribute is always welcome to do so. All discussion and project organisation takes place in the `#osu-news` channel of the [osu!dev Discord server](/wiki/Community/osu!dev_Discord_server).

## History

The original run of osu!monthly created by [jjrocks](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30985), [Corin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/639270), and friends ran from March 2011 to October 2011. The magazine was then released in a PDF format with all the most important information about the osu! community.

Inspired by the first version of the osu!monthly, a new team was formed, thanks to [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) and [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350), and new iterations of the monthly could be published from October 2017 to February 2018. The format was still PDF at the time, but with more consistent and pleasing design.

With a desire to once again revive this project, the [osu!monthly team](/wiki/People/osu!monthly_team) was formed with [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724) at the helm, reviving the project, this time directly as news posts. The project is currently ongoing.
